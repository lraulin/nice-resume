    "bio": [
      "After a previous life as an English teacher in Korea, a stint in the Coast Guard, and an Master's in psychology, I finally found my calling as a programmer.",
      "It began with using mods for Oblivion, when I discovered I found the process of troublshooting addictive. From there, I began using Linux as my primary OS, and the rest is history. In the last several years, I have been delighted to discover that I can use my skills to solve real problems in the worlds of business and government.",
      "I'm confident I could build a REST API in any language at this point, but JavaScript (React, Express, Node...any database) is where I am most comfortable. Eric Elliot, Douglas Crockford, and Kyle Simpson convinced me that it is not only as good as any general-purpose programming language for most purposes; it is almost beautiful in its own way.",
      "Python was my first language, and still second favorite. I'm also pretty handy with Bash, and recieved 3 months of formal training each in C# and Java.",
      "My personality could be described as dopaminergic. My brain is ravenous and restless. I've sometimes felt as if I want to devour the world.",
      "I am fascinated by psychology and neuroscience, especially their practical relevance for self-understanding and better living. I keep my body and brain and healthy with light hygeine, self-generated optic flow (ie walking and running), calisthenics, club swinging, yoga, breathwork, and daily ice baths in the Chesapeake Bay."
