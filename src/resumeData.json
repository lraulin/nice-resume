    "bio": [
      "After a previous life as an English teacher in Korea, a stint in the Coast Guard, and an Master's in psychology, I finally found my calling as a programmer.",
      "It began with using mods for Oblivion, when I discovered I found the process of troublshooting addictive. From there, I began using Linux as my primary OS, and the rest is history. In the last several years, I have been delighted to discover that I can use my skills to solve real problems in the worlds of business and government.",
      "I'm confident I could build a REST API in any language at this point, but JavaScript (React, Express, Node...any database) is where I am most comfortable. Eric Elliot, Douglas Crockford, and Kyle Simpson convinced me that it is not only as good as any general-purpose programming language for most purposes; it is almost beautiful in its own way.",
      "Python was my first language, and still second favorite. I'm also pretty handy with Bash, and recieved 3 months of formal training each in C# and Java.",
      "My personality could be described as dopaminergic. My brain is ravenous and restless. I've sometimes felt as if I want to devour the world.",
      "I am fascinated by psychology and neuroscience, especially their practical relevance for self-understanding and better living. I keep my body and brain and healthy with light hygeine, self-generated optic flow (ie walking and running), calisthenics, club swinging, yoga, breathwork, and daily ice baths in the Chesapeake Bay."

It is used by myself and several of my coworkers to speed our work on a daily basis. I have been developing my Pandas skills to perform data cleaning on spreadsheets.
